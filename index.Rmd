## About me

I’m passionate about advancing health equity in population oral health through epidemiological methods. I'm currently a Master’s student in Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Dentistry (BDS) from CES University in Medellín, Colombia. 

My work integrates research and clinical practice, focusing on the intersection of social and oral health epidemiology, including conditions like cleft lip and palate. While pursuing my degree, I also work as a research assistant, coordinating community-based HIV research projects in Latino populations. 

I also serve as president of the Latino Public Health Network student group and as Master's Co-Representative of the Epidemiology Student Organization (ESO) at JHSPH. My research collaborations include work with CES-LPH in Colombia and the Cariology Research Group at UT Health, San Antonio.
